            <p>Air Blade values the knowledge and experience of the technicians in order to obtain the most accurate results, and for that all our teams are composed by certified and experienced rope access Wind Turbine Blade inspectors. When we preform an inspection we know what we are looking for. Our engineers have more than 15 years of experience inspecting and repairing wind turbine blades. We have been involved in all different stages of a bladeâ€™s life span, inspecting and reporting:Quality Production; Transport Damages; After Assembly; End of Warranty and General Maintenance</p>
